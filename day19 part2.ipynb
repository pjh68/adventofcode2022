    "A classic resource and machine building strategy game.\n",
    "\n",
    "First up, let's have a quick check of the size of the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "24 Minutes, with a minute-resolution simulation.\n",
    "Puzzle input contains 30 blueprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blueprints vary the quantity of the source materials required, but they don't change the type of resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A first glance, this looks similar to the valves puzzle from a few days ago. I solved that using a brute-force technique, checking every single possible option (and discarding some obvious losers along the way to improve performance).\n",
    "But there are so many more possibilities here, that taking that approach seems wrong. And also a bit repetative... I want to try something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "So... how about having a strategy engine that works backwards from the goal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generic recipes:\n",
    "a Ore              -> ore bot   -> Ore\n",
    "b Ore              -> clay bot  -> Clay\n",
    "c Ore + d Clay     -> obs bot   -> Obsidian\n",
    "e Ore + f Obsidian -> geode bot -> Geode\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-arrange to work backwards: (and ignoring time)\n",
    "1 Geode = e Ore + f Obsidian\n",
    "        = e Ore + f (c Ore + d Clay)\n",
    "        = e Ore + fc Ore + fdb Ore \n",
    "        = ( e + fc + fdb ) Ore\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with 1 ore collecting Robot.\n",
    "Ore is the primary contraint... but we don't want an ore stock-pile at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other approaches to consider... could this be turned into a single function that can be optimised? \n",
    "What would the inputs be? The choice how many robots of each type to build in each minute.\n",
    "But it's integer choices... so we're into integer programming - maybe try using: https://www.cvxpy.org/examples/applications/OOCO.html\n",
    "\n",
    "But perhaps I should try a slightly more straightforward way first?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many hours in, straightforward isn't working. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is this a clue in the puzzle?\n",
    "\"The elephants are starting to look hungry, so you shouldn't take too long; you need to figure out which blueprint would maximize the number of opened geodes after 24 minutes by figuring out which robots to build and when to build them.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Hungry suggests a greedy algorithm.\n",
    "But already discovered that doens't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Urgghrr.... close to giving up. Do I just brute force it again?\n",
