    "You step carefully; as you do, the ropes stretch and twist. You decide to distract yourself by modeling rope physics; maybe you can even figure out where not to step.\n",

    "Due to nebulous reasoning involving Planck lengths, you should be able to model the positions of the knots on a two-dimensional grid. Then, by following a hypothetical series of motions (your puzzle input) for the head, you can determine how the tail will move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the aforementioned Planck lengths, the rope must be quite short; in fact, the head (H) and tail (T) must always be touching (diagonally adjacent and even overlapping both count as touching):\n",

    "1. What data structure to hold H and T positions? Do I just hold their coordinates?\n",

    "4. Where does it start? How large is the grid? These aren't specified, so may need to dynamically resize the grid as I go\n",
